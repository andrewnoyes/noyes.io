Various links of things I have been wanting to check out at some point. I had been keeping these in bookmarks, but the default experience lacks re-discoverability so stuff just kinda sits there. For now I'll see if putting it here increases the likelihood of revisiting them.

- [Papers for Software Engineers](https://github.com/facundoolano/software-papers)
- [Capitalism and Computers in the Era of A.I. (syllabus)](https://cceai.ohrg.org/syllabus.pdf)
- [Post-Open Source](https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html)
