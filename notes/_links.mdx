Dumping ground for various links of things I have read or been wanting to check out at some point. I had been keeping these in bookmarks, but the default experience lacks re-discoverability so stuff just kinda sits there. For now I'll see if putting it here increases the likelihood of revisiting them.

Tech [critique]:

Local/offline first:

- [jazz](https://jazz.tools/)
- [triplit](https://www.triplit.dev/)
- [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/): research lab with primary themes: malleable software, programmable ink, local-first (I think [they coined this term](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/)?)
- [earthstar project](https://earthstar-project.org/): distributed, offline-first database
- [electric-sql](https://electric-sql.com/): sync postgres database into local apps
- [Instant](https://github.com/instantdb/instant): "modern firebase", appears to be self-hostable
- [Ditto](https://ditto.com): "mobile database with built-in edge device connectivity" - appears to be just a product offering, not open source/code

Architecture/refactoring:

- [Modularizing React Applications with Established UI Patterns](https://martinfowler.com/articles/modularizing-react-apps.html)

Desktop apps/electron alternatives:

- [Tauri](https://tauri.app): using Rust. i think their v2 now supports mobile apps?
- [Wails](https://wails.io/docs/introduction/): using Go lang

Imported from my "CRDT" bookmarks, still needs some cleanup!

These were imported from my "noted" bookmarks folder, and it's kinda all over the place. The main themes are productivity apps, real-time collaboration and off-line first (I think crdt stuff bleeds into here as well), and probably some UI/design ideas!
