This was pulled from [css-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/emoji-as-a-favicon/) which I think also pulls it from a tweet or something.

> Put the emoji inside an **svg** element and set that as the favicon: `<link rel="icon" href="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 100 100%22><text y=%22.9em%22 font-size=%2290%22>👍</text></svg>">`
