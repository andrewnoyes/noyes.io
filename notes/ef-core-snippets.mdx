[Debugging EF Core change tracking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/change-tracking/debug-views). To view the debug view from the console:

`Console.WriteLine(context.ChangeTracker.DebugView.ShortView);`

> The debug view has a short form and a long form. The short form shows tracked entities, their state, and key values. The long form also includes all property and navigation values and state.
