- Build something in [gleam](https://gleam.run)!
  - Erlang and its VM (BEAM) have had my interest for a bit - faul tolerant, real-time, concurrency features, etc - but I've been resistant because Erlang is dynamically typed, and I want my types! ([Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) is also a newer, popular language that runs on BEAM, but its typing is also dynamic!)
  - Gleam is cool because it: runs on the erlang VM, is statically typed, and has a syntax that I've enjoyed so far (kinda looks like rust mixed with some functional features?).
  - While its popularity and ecosystem are on the rise (according to [star-history](https://star-history.com/#gleam-lang/gleam), gleam-lang has tripled like in just this year?!), there's definitely opportunities to contribute libraries to - which would be neat because I don't have a ton of experience with library development!
- Jail support software! During the uprising people had a very hard time coordinating jail support. It'd be great if you could have a system to manage "cases" when someone gets arrested. Could manage contact info, how to reach people in what jail, who is the point person on each case, track people that are detained so they don't disappear into the system. People could optionally provide their contact info ahead of time, maybe even say if they're going to an event so they could be "checked in on" later after the event. Friends could report people as being detained, could help coordinate bail funds and provide transparency around bail funds, etc...
- Universal inbox/notifications app: connect various services into a unified inbox where you can view and directly respond to eg slack, GitHub, discord notifications, etc. Mainly just a fun exercise for bidirectional syncing of multiple services and interacting with their apis in a unified way -
  - Bonus points to build it as a local-first application, maybe using [Tauri](https://tauri.app)?!
