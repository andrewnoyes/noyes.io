**Commands I use frequently:**

- If you've updated your code, you can do the build and reload in a single step with:

  `docker-compose up --detach --build {service-name}`

- [Restart a single container with docker-compose](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31466428/how-to-restart-a-single-container-with-docker-compose):

  `docker-compose restart worker`

- Stop all containers:

  `docker kill $(docker ps -q)`

- Remove all containers

  `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`

- Remove all docker images

  `docker rmi $(docker images -q)`

- Run interactive shell to explore containers:

  `docker run -it image_name sh`

- Or following for images with an _entrypoint_

  `docker run -it --entrypoint sh image_name`

- If you want to see how the image was build, meaning the steps in its _dockerfile_, you can:

  `docker image history --no-trunc image_name > image_history`
