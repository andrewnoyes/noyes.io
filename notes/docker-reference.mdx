**Tools**:

- [ctop](https://github.com/bcicen/ctop): top-like interface for containers
- [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive): cli tool for exploring docker image layers

**Cheatsheet:** [https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Dockerfile.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Dockerfile.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index)

**Commands I use frequently:**

- If you've updated your code, you can do the build and reload in a single step with:

  `docker compose up --detach --build {service-name}`

- [Restart a single container with docker-compose](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31466428/how-to-restart-a-single-container-with-docker-compose):

  `docker compose restart worker`

- Run interactive shell to explore containers:

  `docker run -it image_name sh`

- Or following for images with an _entrypoint_

  `docker run -it --entrypoint sh image_name`

- If you want to see how the image was build, meaning the steps in its _dockerfile_, you can:

  `docker image history --no-trunc image_name > image_history`
