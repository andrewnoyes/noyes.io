# Welcome to the WIP Notes section!

---

**Some ideas for what else to display here:**

- Recently added/viewed/favorited(stored locally?) notes
- Save tags and display notes grouped by those tags
- Client tools for working with notes in like a scratchpad fashion; save to indexeddb/localstorage;
- Link to note file in github repo and provide download button to save the markdown/mdx file
