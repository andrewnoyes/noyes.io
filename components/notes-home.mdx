# Welcome to the WIP Notes section!

---

**TODOS:**

- [ ] Update mdx-components.tsx for the code block to include a copy button that will copy the code contents to clipboard
- [ ] Figure out how to get checkboxes rendering correctly from mdx files

**Some ideas for what else to display here when no note is selected:**

- Recently added/viewed/favorited(stored locally?) notes
- Save tags and display notes grouped by those tags
- Client tools for working with notes in like a scratchpad fashion; save to indexeddb/localstorage;
