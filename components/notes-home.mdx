# Welcome to the WIP Notes section!

**Some ideas for what else to display here when no note is selected:**

- Recently added/viewed/favorited(stored locally?) notes
- Save tags and display notes grouped by those tags
- Client tools for working with notes in like a scratchpad fashion; save to indexeddb/localstorage;

**copdb todos:**

- [ ] Look at refactoring the auth logic to utilize more of the framework after .net was upgraded to 9.0
